# Replicating of paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) with Pytorch

This repository contains the code and necessary files to replicate the paper ["An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale".](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.11929.pdf)

The paper proposes a new architecture for image recognition, called Vision Transformer (ViT), which utilizes transformers, a type of neural network architecture originally introduced for natural language processing.
